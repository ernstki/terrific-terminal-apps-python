# Purpose-built Programming Languages in Unix

<small>_or_, the mini-programming languages right under your nose</small>

<small><http://FIXME></small>

---
## The Unix "Shell"

it's a text-based interface to the Unix operating system
<!-- -->

    
which means you _type in_ commands to examine your files, copy, move, or
otherwise manipulate their contents
<!-- -->

    
it's also a built-in programming language with a "[read-eval-print loop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)"
<!-- -->


...which means you can enter in programs one line at a time and see the
execution results immediately

.footnote[
**See also:** <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/205982?autoplay=1" target="_blank">
brief "shell as a REPL" demo</a> (asciinema.org, in a new tab)
]

---
### The Unix "Shell" (cont'd)

buuuuuuut... because the shell is actually a general-purpose programming
language,

and since this presentation isn't really about _general-purpose_ programming with the shell,

we'll table that full discussion for a later date.

.footnote[
**But if you're interested, start here:**<br>[Bash Guide for Beginners](http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/index.html);
[The Art of Command Line](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line)
]

---
## "Purpose-built"?

some "programming languages" are specially designed for one thing

* pattern matching (wildcards, [regular expressions](https://man.cx/regex(7))
* manipulating "streams" of text ([`sed`](https://man.cx/sed))
* working with column-based (delimited) data files ([`awk`](https://man.cx/awk))
* doing math ([`bc`](https://man.cx/bc) and `dc`)
    
<small>...that is, they may lack features necessary to solve _any_ general
purpose computational problem, such as loops, conditionals, or
functions (composability and modularity)</small>

---
## Shell wildcards (_a.k.a._, "globs")

Used to "filter" file listings by only showing matching files
<!-- -->


"`*`" (asterisk) means "zero or more of any character"
<!-- -->

```bash
# list all files ending in '*.fastq.gz'
ls *.fastq.gz
```
<!-- -->

"`?`" means "exactly one character, but which one, I don't care"
<!-- -->

```bash
# list files that end in '.ba' folled by any single character
# (e.g., '.bat' or '.bak')
ls *.ba?
```
<!-- -->

(and obviously you can combine them)


---
### Globs (cont'd)

square brackets denote a "character class"
<!-- -->
 (that is, match any **one** character in this set)
<!-- -->

```bash
# list all files beginning with either upper- or lower-case 'C'
ls [Cc]*
```
<!-- -->

and these can be combined with other wildcards
<!-- -->

```bash
# list all files with .tar.gz or .tar.bz2 extensions
ls *.[bg]z*
```
<!-- -->

(remember that the asterisk here means "zero or more of any character")

---
### Globs (cont'd)

ranges of characters are also supported
<!-- -->

```bash
# list all files beginning with a letter
ls [a-zA-Z]*
```
<!-- -->

```bash
# all files ending with a three-digit extension
ls *.[0-9][0-9][0-9]
```
<!-- -->

as are "inverse" sets
<!-- -->

```bash
# list all files that do *NOT* begin with a letter
ls [^a-zA-Z]*
```

---
## Shell math

you can do inline math with `$(( expr ))`
<!-- -->

```bash
echo "Ceci n'est pas une équation: $(( 2 + 2 ))"

# result: Ceci n'est pas une équation: 4
```
<!-- -->

see the complete list of supported operators
[here](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Arithmetic.html#Shell-Arithmetic)
<!-- -->

.footnote[
**NB**: the Bash shell actually has several such "[shell
expansions](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Expansions.html#Shell-Expansions),"
including [command
substitution](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Substitution.html#Command-Substitution)
(_a.k.a._, backticks)
]

---
### Shell math (cont'd)

...and you can store the value of arithmetic expressions in variables
<!-- -->

```bash
i=1027

# the '/' does "integer division" (floors the result)
quotient=$(( i / 8 ))

# the '$' is not required inside arithmetic expansions
remainder=$(( i % 8 ))

echo "$i / 8 = $quotient R$remainder"
# result: 1027 / 8 = 128 R3
```

---
### Shell math (cont'd)

also, just FYI, there are also these special cases for `for` loops
<!-- -->

```bash
for (( i=0; i<10; i++ )); do
    echo "$i is not yet 10!"
done
```
<!-- -->

...and `while` loops, as well conditional expressions, as seen below

```bash
beer=99; s='s'

while (( beer )); do
    echo "$beer bottle${s} of beer on the wall"
    beer=$(( beer - 1 ))
    # set variable 's' to the empty string when 'beer' equals 1
    (( beer == 1 )) && s=
done
```

---
### Still more shell math

for more complicated operations (including floating point math), you can rely
on [`bc`](https://man.cx/bc)

```bash
# simple shell calculator (quotes not *technically* required here)
echo "5/3" | bc

# or, using a Bash feature called a "here string"
bc <<<"5/3"

# result: 1.66666666666666666666
```
<!-- -->

and you can use [command substitution](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Substitution.html#Command-Substitution)
here, too

```bash
echo "The value of π ≈ $( bc <<< "scale=6; 22 / 7" )"

# result: The value of π ≈ 3.142857
```

---
## Brace expansion

expands all members of a "set" one at a time, delimited by spaces

```bash
echo {Th,h,th,th,c}at had

# result: That hat that that cat had
```

<!-- -->

print a list of all trimers

```bash
echo {a,c,t,g}{a,c,t,g}{a,c,t,g}

# result: aaa aac aat aag aca acc act acg ata atc att [...]
```
<!-- -->

.footnote[
**NB**: The first example exploits [word splitting](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/WordSplitting);
this would _not_ work if the whole string were quoted.
]

---
## Pipes, man

<!-- -->
they're _so good_

```bash
# random 32-character alphanumeric string
cat /dev/urandom       |
    tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' |
    fold -w 32         |
    head -1

# result: tMhc9feAGgg8NS1MUu10dzNbEBf9Tdjk
```

* `/dev/urandom` - "device special file" that spews random bytes
* `tr` - translates or deletes sets of characters
* `fold` - wraps all lines at 32 characters
* `head` returns just the first line of the input

---
### Pipes (cont'd)
    
OK, so how do I capture that in a variable so I can do something
useful with it?

easy: [command substitution](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Substitution.html#Command-Substitution)
<!-- -->

```bash
# capture the random string in a shell variable
ID=$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 32 | head -1)
```

then, just use that variable `$ID` somewhere else.

## Regular Expressions

tune in next time for a whirlwind tour of

* [`grep`](https://man.cx/grep) - the "global regular expression printer"
* [`sed`](https://man.cx/sed) - the "stream editor"
* [`awk`](https://man.cx/awk) - funny name, serious programming language
* [`perl`](https://man.cx/perlrun) - the pathologically eclectic rubbish
    lister<br>(useful one-liners anyway)
* and (yay!) [regular expressions][regex7]!

## Next episode: `sed`

this actual `sed` program merges consecutive lines under "Term" headers
in the [BRENDA tissue ontology](https://www.brenda-enzymes.info/ontology/tissue/tree/update/update_files/BrendaTissueOBO)

```sed
/^\[Term/!b  # branch to end if the line doesn't start w/ "[Term"
n            # read the next line of input
:a           # label 'a'
H            # append the current line to the hold space
n            # get the next line
/^$/!ba      # if line is NOT empty, branch to 'a'
x            # otherwise, exchange the hold space w/ pattern space
s/^\n//      # remove the leading newline
s/\n/\t/g    # replace all the remaining ones with tabs
p            # print what we got (remember to run script w/ '-n')
```
<!-- -->

<small>(the English comments off to the right are for _me_, so can still
I understand what the heck all this does a year from now)</small>

---
## Next episode: AWK

print the username (`$1`) and full name (`$5`) of all the Smiths

```bash
getent passwd | awk -F: '$5 ~ /^[Ss]mith/ { print $1 " - " $5 }'

# result:
# baue5r - Smith, Laura
# mer7am - Smith, Roberta
# smiar8 - Smith, Shane
```
<!-- -->

count how many Ernsts have cluster accounts

```bash
getent passwd |
    awk -F: '$5 ~ /^[Ee]rnst/ { count++ }; END { print count }'
```
<!-- -->
