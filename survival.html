## the Unix "shell"

is a text-based interface to a Unix operating system

the cool kids use [`zsh`](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/), and your PI probably
uses [`csh`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_shell)

but the default one is `bash`, the "Bourne Again Shell"

```bash
echo $SHELL
# result: /bin/bash
```

and it is fine and good

so we will talk about Bash

---
## the Unix "shell" (cont'd)

did you know…

it's also a built-in programming language with a "[read-eval-print loop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)"

…which means you can enter in programs one line at a time and see the
execution results immediately

<small>(users of Mathematica, MATLAB, or RStudio will find this familiar)</small>

but there are also some arcane behaviors (it's a [50-year-old OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix), after all) and dark corners you could get stuck in

## so, complexity

the Unix shell is a complex and powerful system, with a sometimes-daunting user
interface

and humans, rightfully (!), have an atavistic fear of powerful things

## chainsaws

powerful things evoke fear

## &ldquo;proficiency fatalism&rdquo;<span style="color:red">\*</span>

don't succumb to it

we have a tendency to see an expert at their craft and say, &ldquo;oh, I could never do that,&rdquo; but…

* [it is a fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-history_illusion) to think you cannot master new skills
* every expert was a novice at first
* [pair-programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) is a great way to level up

---
## avoid the &ldquo;Tar Pit of Immediacy&rdquo;<span style="color:red">\*</span>

if you can, instead:

* slow down; read the documentation to gain understanding
    * rather than simply copy-pasting from Stack Overflow
* comment your code
* modularize<span style="color:red">\*\*</span>
* envision a long-lived, well-documented, and reusable solution

a well-thought-out solution often wins over a quick-and-dirty one (amortized over the life of a project)

## tips for survival &ndash; the shell

* put this in your `~/.bashrc` right now
      ```bash
      alias rm='rm -i'
      alias mv='mv -i'
      alias cp='cp -i'
      alias ln='ln -i'
      ```
    * use `\rm` or `rm -f` if you _don't_ want to be prompted
* set `$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL` to an editor you understand
      ```bash
      # also in ~/.bashrc
      export EDITOR='nano' VISUAL='nano'
      ```
* that said, do [`vimtutor`](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_01.html#vimtutor)
    * seriously, learn enough `vi` to be dangerous

---
## tips for survival &ndash; the shell (cont'd)

* mind your line endings: [required reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline)
    * _<abbr title="Too Long; Didn't Read">tl;dr</abbr> version: use `dos2unix FILENAME`_
* Unix text files are **linefeed-terminated** (ASCII `LF`, `\x0a`)
   * files missing a final terminating LF won't parse correctly
   * files with CR+LF (DOS/Windows) line endings won't either

now, do this experiment
* create a text file using Windows Notepad
* save it or email it to a Unix machine (macOS is Unix)
* run `file`, then `cat -A` (`-vte` on Mac) on the file
* then, convert with `dos2unix` and compare
    * see also: `man 7 ascii`

---
## tips for survival &ndash; the shell (cont'd)

* preemptively scan through the [Bash FAQ](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ) and [Pitfalls](Bash Pitfalls)
    * fix your own [antipatterns](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/AntiPattern.html)
* always [quote your variables](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/Quotes)
* understand [word splitting](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/WordSplitting)
* don't parse the output of `ls` [[ref](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/ParsingLs)]
    * instead, use something like `for csv in *.csv; do …`<br>
      (and always quote your iterator variable)
    * use `find -exec` for more complicated cases
* understand what the "secondary prompt string" (`$PS2`) means
* learn to use [job control](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Job-Control-Basics.html) and [signals](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Signals.html)
    * `kill -9` is a blunt instrument

---
## tips for survival &ndash; WTF!?

programs can appear to be frozen that are actually fine

* did you forget to specify the input filename?
    * "Unix toolkit" programs expect input on stdin
    * if you don't give them an input file, they will wait for input from the
      keyboard
    * <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> signals "end of input" (mnemonic: "D" is for "done")
* did you accidentally press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>?
  [[ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_flow_control)]
    * try pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> (resume flow control)
        * on Windows, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> is probably in your muscle
          memory as "Save"
        * in the Unix terminal, it means **stop flow control** (pause terminal output)
        * and this use probably predates "File → Save" by some decades
<!--        * on this one point, Mac keyboards are less aggravating, because -->
<!--          application shortcuts are typically bound to <kbd>⌘Command</kdb> -->

---
## tips for survival &ndash; job control

okay, this program is _really_ locked up, for real

* if it's _really_ not responding, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>
    * then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> (suspend), followed by `kill %1`
    * then `kill -HUP`, then `kill -QUIT`
    * and as an absolute **last resort**: `kill -9`
* if the InterWebs suggests `kill -9`, be skeptical
    * `kill -9` doesn't give the program a chance to clean up after itself
      (close open files, flush buffers, close network sockets)
    * it's almost never necessary, except when there's some blocking (network)
      I/O, or a hardware failure
    * programs that are trying desperately to flush unwritten data buffers to
      disk really don't want to be killed in the middle of that

---
## tips for survival &ndash; the terminal

accidentally `cat`ted a binary, now the terminal's messed up?

* try `reset`, first, and if that doesn't work…
* `stty sane` &ndash; resets the terminal's brains

don't just hold down the arrow keys (or backspace)

* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> - move to beginning / end of line
    * handy if <kbd>Home</kbd> / <kbd>End</kbd> are in a bad position on your
      (laptop) keyboard
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>U</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>
    * delete from cursor position to beginning / end of line
    * <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>U</kbd> is great for clearing a mistake in
      a <tt>Password:</tt> prompt
* or just `set -o vi` if you're of the `vi` persuasion

---
## tips for survival &ndash; scripting

<small>5 extra minutes spent documenting it now could spare 5 hours of
frustrated head-scratching later… do it for future-you</small>

* **always** add a comment header, even for one-offs
    * a good name and a clear description, your name, email, and a date
* always cite your sources
    * _e.g._, include a link to the [SO](https://stackoverflow.com) thread that solved your problem
* `set -u` &ndash; terminate on unset variables
* always [quote your variables](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/Quotes)
* use `${infile:?filename required!}` for cheap argument validation
    * in fact, learn all about [parameter substitution](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html)
* do not ignore the exit code of subprocesses (`$?`)

---
## tips for survival &ndash; scripting (cont'd)

shell scripting for data processing tasks:

* you _can_ do it in Awk or sed (for most definitions of "it")
    * …probably with less code than R, Python, or your favorite language
    * build proficiency over time with small challenges
        * could I solve _this_ problem with Awk? sed?
* shell script is an ideal "glue language"
    * classic Unix toolkit programs generally do "[one thing well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Doug_McIlroy_on_Unix_programming)" and exchange data via text streams
    * if you design your programs to do the same, **you can extend that toolkit in novel ways**
* or, maybe, just **don't use shell script**
    * if a specific thing is easier in some other language, then do that
        * unless you're trying to hone your shell-scripting skills, that is

---
## tips for proficiency and mastery

* use your command-line history [more effectively](https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/better-bash-history/)
    * learn about [`fc`](https://shapeshed.com/unix-fc/), use
      <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>, customize your
      [`.inputrc`](https://gist.github.com/ernstki/4f370ada5e9ba02a57799ad88b3e855f#file-dot-inputrc)
* use more loops, wildcards, and [parameter substitution](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html)
    * this is easily 10&times; less code than your regular programming language
        ```bash
        for bam in *.bam; do
            samtools fastq "$bam" > "${bam%.bam}.fastq"
        done
        ```
* use [more pipes](https://youtu.be/sCZJblyT_XM?t=833)!
* write shell functions to [encapsulate complexity](https://github.com/erichs/composure)
* use [command](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Substitution.html) and [process substitution](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Process-Substitution.html)
* _really_ learn shell [pattern matching](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pattern-Matching.html) and [regexes](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html) ([workshop](FIXME))

---
## tips for .struck[proficiency and mastery] life

* don't be afraid to experiment
    * you (probably) won't break it
* constructive failures are a kind of success
    * what's the difference between the student and the master?
        * simply that the master has failed more times than the student has tried
* breathe, slow down, take a short walk
    * you'll figure it out eventually <tt>:)</tt>
* **don't be afraid to ask a human**
    * the robot overlords don't have _all_ the answers (yet)
    * Stack Overflow is cool, though

# now, specifics

## use [loops](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Looping-Constructs.html)

you don't need to parse the output of `ls` ([so don't](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/ParsingLs))

```bash
for fastq in *.fastq; do
    shasum -a 1 "$fastq" >> SHA1SUMS
done
```

(use `find -exec` for more complicated cases<span style="color:red">*</span>)

also, just FYI, "C style" `for` loops are supported in Bash

```bash
for (( i=0; i<10; i++ )); do
    echo "$i is not yet 10!"
done
```

.footnote[
<span style="color:red">*</span>or put some time into learning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL284C9FF2488BC6D1" target="_blank">GNU Parallel</a> 
]

---
## use [loops](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Looping-Constructs.html) (cont'd)

Bash `while` loops can use normal conditional expressions in `[[ … ]]`, as well
as math expressions in `(( … ))`

```bash
beer=99; s='s'

while (( beer )); do
    echo "$beer bottle${s} of beer on the wall"
    beer=$(( beer - 1 ))
    # set variable 's' to the empty string when 'beer' equals 1
    (( beer == 1 )) && s=
done
```

* they're basically built-in commands that return "true" (zero exit) or
 "false" (non-zero exit) based on what's inside
    * in the case of `(( … ))`, if the math expression produces a non-zero
      numeric result, that counts as "true"; zero or empty/null is "false"

---
## don't throw away return values

_any_ command that returns non-zero on failure **can be used as
the condition** in loops, conditionals, and [short-circuit Boolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation) expressions


```bash
# '&>/dev/null' suppresses both stderr and stdout
while ping -c1 google.com &>/dev/null; do
    echo "The googles are still googling."
    sleep 3600  # for an hour
done
```

```bash
if grep -q 'FAILURE' "$logfile"; then
    echo "OH NOES. IT HAS FAILED. :(" >&2
fi
```

```bash
# '||' is Boolean OR; the operator for AND is '&&'
[[ $n =~ /^[1-9][0-9]+$/ ]] || echo "Expected an integer ≥1."
```

---
## use [command substitution](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Substitution.html) 

did you know? [`bc`](https://man.cx/bc) does floating point math in the shell

```bash
# simple shell calculator
# quotes not technically required here, just get in the habit
echo '5/3' | bc

# or, using a Bash feature called a "here string"
bc <<<'5/3'

# result: 1.66666666666666666666
```

command substitution captures a command's output<br>
**as a string**, and automatically trims the final newline

```bash
echo "The value of π ≈ $( bc <<< "scale=6; 22 / 7" )"

# result: The value of π ≈ 3.142857
```

---
## use [process substitution](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Process-Substitution.html)

process substitution captures a command's output<br>
**as a (temporary) file**, which is automatically removed

```bash
# join files on the 1st column after sorting numerically
# (without creating intermediate files)
join <(sort -k1,1n file1) <(sort -k1,1n file2)
```

imagine wherever you see `<( … )` that it's being replaced by the filename of
the temporary file

<small>(because under the hood, it is, with a funny name like `/dev/fd/63`)</small>

---
## use [process substitution](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Process-Substitution.html) (cont'd)

if you pipe input into a loop, like `cmd | while read …`
* the pipe invokes a subshell—that's what pipes do
* but subshells **can't alter the state of the parent shell**
    * _i.e._, create or update variables in the parent environment
* process substitution is useful in this scenario
    * [BashFAQ/024](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/024) explains this in
detail<span style="color:red">\*</span>

```bash
# shell redirection creates no subshell, so this DOES work
count=0
while read group; do count=$((count+1)); done \
  < <(id | sed 's/.*groups=//' | tr , \\n)

echo "My user account is a member of $count groups!"
```

.footnote[
<span style="color:red">\*</span>**see also**: <a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/ProcessSubstitution" target="_blank">Process Substitution</a> on <a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/EnglishFrontPage" target="_blank">Greg's Wiki</a>, a top-notch resource for Bash scripting
]

---
## use [brace expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Brace-Expansion.html), like a boss

expands all members of a "set" one at a time, delimited by spaces; when
concatenated, the expansions are expanded

```bash
echo {Th,h,th,th,c}at had

# result: That hat that that cat had
```

```bash
# move *.bam and *.bai to some other directory
mv *.ba{m,i} some/other/dir
```

```bash
# print a list of all trimers
echo {a,c,t,g}{a,c,t,g}{a,c,t,g}

# result: aaa aac aat aag aca acc act acg ata atc att [...]
```

.footnote[
**NB**: The first example exploits <a href="http://mywiki.wooledge.org/WordSplitting" target="_blank">word splitting</a>;
that example would _not_ produce the output shown if the whole string were quoted.
]

---
## use [shell functions](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Functions.html) and fear no `eval`<span style="color:red">\*</span>


```bash
# print list of all k-mers, for user-provided value of 'k' ($1)
kmer() {
    local s=

    if ! [[ $1 =~ /^[1-9][0-9]+$/ ]]; then
        # return failure if $1 is empty or non-numeric
        echo 'usage: kmer <int>' >&2; return 1
    fi

    for (( k=1; k<=$1; k++ )); do s+="{A,C,T,G}"; done
    eval "echo $s"
}
```

<small>**here's what's happening**: the individual `{A,C,T,G}` brace
expressions are built up in `k` parts in the `for` loop, inside a double-quoted
string to defer brace expansion until it's all `eval`'d at the end</small>

.footnote[
<span style="color:red">\*</span>(just don't `eval` unsanitized user input in
an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid" target="_blank">suid-root</a> script)
]

---
## use more [aliases](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Aliases.html)

aliases can be used
* to bundle frequently-used options, with a new name
    * _e.g._, `alias 8mer='kmer 8'` or `alias whence='type -a'`
* as nicknames for commands that are hard to type
    * `alias ngacl='nfs4_getfacl'`
* to correct common misspelings
    * `alias pusdh='pushd'; alias podp='popd'`

things to note
* aliases can't take arguments (`$1`, `$2`, …) like functions can
* they're temporary, unless you put them in your `~/.bashrc`

## use more [pipes](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pipelines.html) &ndash; they're so good!

```bash
# random 32-character alphanumeric string
cat /dev/urandom       |
    tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' |
    fold -w 32         |
    head -1

# result: tMhc9feAGgg8NS1MUu10dzNbEBf9Tdjk
```

* `cat` &ndash; outputs the contents of a file
* `/dev/urandom` &ndash; "device special file", emits random bytes
* `tr` &ndash; translates or deletes sets of characters
* `fold` &ndash; wraps all lines at 32 characters
* `head` &ndash; returns just the first line of the input<span style="color:red">\*</span>

.footnote[
<span style="color:red">*</span>`head` has a `-c` option (return a specified
number of bytes), which would _also_ work here, since it's only ASCII
characters; use `fold` for Unicode/multi-byte character sets

## use more [pipes](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pipelines.html) (cont'd)
    
OK, so how do I capture that in a variable so I can do something
useful with it?

easy: [command substitution](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Substitution.html#Command-Substitution)
<!-- -->

```bash
# capture the random string in a shell variable
ID=$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 32 | head -1)
```

then, just use that variable `$ID` somewhere else.

## _really_ learn pattern matching &amp; <abbr title="regular expressions">regexes</abbr>

* Bash's [shell pattern matching](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pattern-Matching.html) is pretty sophisticated!
* check out the `globstar` [shell option](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Shopt-Builtin.html):
    > If set, the pattern ‘**’ used in a filename expansion
    > context will match all files and zero or more directories and
    > subdirectories. If the pattern is followed by a ‘/’, only directories and
    > subdirectories match.

```bash
shopt -s globstar  # enable the option
ls **/*.bed        # all *.bed files, in all subdirectories
rm -r **/results/  # remove all 'results' subdirectories
```

…but for more advanced use cases, **regular expressions** (_a.k.a._, regexps,
regexes, REs) are the two-stage super-heavy lift orbital launch vehicle of
pattern matching languages

## pattern matching &amp; <abbr title="regular expressions">regexes</abbr> (cont'd)

[regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) are
a specification for an extremely sophisticated grammar for pattern
matching<span style="color:red">\*</span>


* Perl has hands-down the best [regex documentation](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html)
    * available everywhere with `man perlre`, or `perldoc perlre`
    * see [`perltut`](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlretut.html) if you're a newbie
    * see [`perlquick`](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlrequick.html) for the
      cheatsheet version
* just know that `awk`, `sed`, `grep` use more limited dialects
  * called "Basic" and "Extended" REs; see [`regex(7)`](https://linux.die.net/man/7/regex)
* [RegExr](https://regexr.com/) &ndash; visually test and refine complex REs
* regexes are not, however, [a panacea](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454)

.footnote[
<span style="color:red">\*</span>which is so complex you can never hope to
understand it in this lifetime, and that is OK

## tune in next time…

…for a whirlwind tour of

* [`grep`](https://man.cx/grep) &ndash; the "global regular expression printer"
* [`sed`](https://man.cx/sed) &ndash; the "stream editor"
* [`awk`](https://man.cx/awk) &ndash; like Excel for the command line
* [`perl`](https://man.cx/perlrun) &ndash; the pathologically eclectic rubbish
    lister
* and (the joys of) [regular expressions][regex7]!
